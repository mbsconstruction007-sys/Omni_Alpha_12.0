## 🚀 **INSTALLATION & USAGE**

### **✅ QUICK START SEQUENCE:**
```bash
# 1. Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements_core.txt

# 2. Copy environment template
cp env_fixed_template.env .env
# (Update .env with your Alpaca secret key)

# 3. Run validation
python fix_and_validate.py

# 4. Start fixed system
python orchestrator_fixed.py
```

### **✅ EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
```
🚀 Initializing Omni Alpha 5.0...
Connecting to databases...
PostgreSQL connection failed: connection refused, using SQLite fallback
Redis connection failed: connection refused, using memory cache
InfluxDB connection failed: connection refused, continuing without metrics DB
Starting monitoring...
Prometheus server started on port 8001
Initializing health checks...
Initializing risk engine...
Connecting to Alpaca...
Alpaca connected: Balance=$100000.00
Streaming started for ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'AAPL']
✅ System initialization complete!

============================================================
🎯 OMNI ALPHA 5.0 - SYSTEM STATUS
============================================================

📦 Components:
   database: ⚠️ DEGRADED - Using fallback database
   risk_engine: ✅ HEALTHY - Risk engine active
   alpaca: ✅ HEALTHY - Connected, streaming 3 symbols

🏥 Overall Health: ⚠️ DEGRADED
   Components: 2/3 healthy

⚙️ Configuration:
   Environment: production
   Trading Mode: paper
   Risk Controls: enabled
   Live Data: enabled

🌐 Endpoints:
   Metrics: http://localhost:8001/metrics

⚠️ System is operational but some features are degraded
